# SORKIN-4 Kerr Scaffold

This directory is currently a Kerr exterior scaffold, not a Kerr causal
reconstruction.

The active L0 check is `audit_kerr_l0_scaffold.py`.  It freezes only two
bookkeeping guarantees:

- `a=0` reproduces the existing Schwarzschild exterior benchmark subset with
  the same generated events and relation states.
- `a=0.5` in scaffold mode leaves every pair undecided.

The corresponding artifact is
`kerr_l0_scaffold_control_a0_a0p5_n12_seed1959.{csv,json,md}`.

Interpretation:

- The `a=0` branch is a regression/control gate.
- The `a!=0` branch is coordinate/event scaffolding only.
- Undecided pairs are unknown pairs, not decided non-relations.
- Local cone and equatorial files in this directory are diagnostics only; they
  are not global Kerr null-geodesic causal decisions.

Before any Kerr physical claim, the next implementation must pass through an
explicit `a=0` regression gate and state exactly which diagnostic is being
added.
